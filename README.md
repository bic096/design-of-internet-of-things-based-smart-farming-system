##graduation project

This project is a Flutter app that enables real-time monitoring and control of  
greenhouse environments for specific plants, using IoT devices and the   
ThingsBoard platform. The app uses the getX state management library for  
efficient data flow and user interface updates.

## Features
* Real-time monitoring of greenhouse environmental data, such as temperature,  
humidity, and light levels.
* Automatic adjustment of environmental factors based on a specific plant's   
profile, such as watering, temperature, and light levels.
* User-friendly interface for controlling and monitoring the system.
Integration with ThingsBoard platform for IoT device management and data  
visualization.
## Installation
To install the Smart Farming System app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Configure the ThingsBoard server and IoT devices according to the project  
documentation.
3. Open the lib/constants.dart file and update the thingsboardUrl and apiKey  
constants with your own values.
4. Run the app on an emulator or physical device using flutter run.
## Usage
To use the Smart Farming System app, follow these steps:

1. Open the app and sign in with your ThingsBoard account credentials.
2. Select the greenhouse environment you want to monitor and control.
3. View real-time data on the greenhouse environment, including temperature,  
humidity, and light levels.
4. Adjust environmental factors by tapping the corresponding buttons or sliders.
5. Configure plant profiles to automatically adjust the environment based on the  
specific needs of each plant.
6. View historical data and trends on the ThingsBoard platform.
## Architecture

The Smart Farming System app uses the getX state management library for efficient  
data flow and user interface updates. The app follows a clean architecture pattern,   
with the following layers:

- Presentation: The user interface and user input handling.
- Application: Orchestrates the use cases of the app and manages the state of the  
presentation layer.
- Domain: Contains the business logic and domain models.
- Infrastructure: Implements the repository interfaces and provides the implementation  
details of the ThingsBoard backend and IoT devices.

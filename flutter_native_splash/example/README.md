# Example for flutter_native_splash

A new Flutter application for testing a splash screen.

## Getting Started

This is Flutter's example application.  Run it now and you will see that it has Flutter's default white splash screen.

The pubspec.yaml file has been modified to add a color and icon to the splash screen.  To apply these modification, run the following command in the terminal:

```
flutter pub get
flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create
```

The updated splash screen will now appear when you run the app.
